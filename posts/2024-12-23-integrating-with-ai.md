# Integrating with AI

The tools being created now are unprecedented. They are getting so good. You can use AI to help you write scripts. You can do more than you ever could. These new powers are fascinating but also worrying. You must learn faster and more, or you will be left entirely behind.

A lot of work needs to be done in the world. And now, access to knowledge is even more without permission-less. The Internet allowed us access to an incredible amount of information. We could learn absolutely anything. We had to rely on experts, and other humans, to help us curate and understand the world. Now, with AI, we all have another layer of an assistant, which can help us navigate the internet. It helps us further understand anything and gives us a level of personalization that can help us even more than ever before. Instead of spending time endlessly searching for our answers, we can be directly provided answers to some of our most pertinent questions.

We've already integrated with technology deeply using smartphones. Apps are quickly adopting AI capabilities. Chatgpt was the fastest-growing app in all of history. And it is just getting better and better over time. New updates are coming every few months, and competitors are coming out of the woodwork. And the future is growing bright.

New tools are coming out that allow us to integrate more and more with AI. Now, some tools work directly on our computers, clicking in the browser, navigating the internet, and doing routine, but also novel tasks for us. We are unlocking real value. Software engineers will become more of a design or architect job than pure coding. We can build more than we can ever before. We were shepherds for computers. But now, we may unlock a whole new layer. There were low-level languages and high-level languages. And now, there will be an entire automation tier expanding significantly. Its growth is enormous and unprecedented. A massive opportunity for the engineers of today.

We are writing the integrations for AI. To allow us to take advantage of whole new capabilities of AI, which will enable us to work better, more efficiently, and do more than we ever could. I want to see those integrations. I need them.

Let's see where we land. Let's build the future. Let's integrate with AI.
