# Creation and Distribution

In today's day and age, it is a superpower to be able to create. You have so much more reach, so much more influence, and can do more than you ever could before.

Right now, everyone is fighting for eyes. And the weird thing is that the real fight in the world is not to build distribution; it is to build something worth centering around.

As Naval said, it is much better to build something worth talking about than to talk endlessly in boardrooms and in meetings. Once you do something significant, your tribe will come to you.

The game of trying to build a following without doing anything is a silly errand. You must first build to find your people.

There are many different ways to build yourself You can stand for something. You can create projects. you can go to school. You can become more educated. There are a myriad of different things you can do to find your tribe.

But the thing that will make it manifest the fastest is to do something deeply and impressively within your domain.

Have the energy to do it. Be prolific. And if you do that, people will find you. That's the key to finding your people. In many ways, you need to be brave enough to have people find you.
